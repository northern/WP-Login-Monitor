# WP-Login-Monitor

A WordPress plugin that sends out and email to the Admin each time a failed authentication occurs.

## Introduction

Login Monitor adds easy notification for failed log in attempts. Whenever a failed log in attempt is made on a website that has Login Monitor enabled, an email will be send out to the website administrator. This way the maintainer of a website knows then someone is trying to gain access to a specific website and which user name and password are being used by the possible intruder.

In terms of privacy, on a website with many users it might not be the best idea to enable Login Monitor. It's quite possible that a valid user is trying to log in and mistypes their password. Something to keep in mind.

## Installation

Installing login Monitor is dead easy. Simply unpack the plugin archive into a plugin directory of choice within the designated WordPress plugin directory. By default the plugin directory will be `login-monitor`.
